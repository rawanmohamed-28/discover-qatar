# Discover Qatar Tourism Website

<h2>About The Project</h2>
Discover Qatar is a travel guide website targeted for tourists who are planning a gateway to Qatar, where they can experience the modern treasures alongside cultural heritage, breathtaking architecture, stunning landscapes, and fun adventures in the heart of the Gulf. This also supports Qatar’s 2030 vision to reach 6 million visitors annually. 

The primary objective of the website is to educate and inspire users about Qatar and the wonders it offers. The website is to inspire visitors and allow them to plan their trip from the golden desert to the cities. The website will allow visitors to discover all the landmarks without missing anything. Discover Qatar provides a detailed travel guide and allows the user to book their flight and accommodation, meaning the whole trip-planning is in one website. 

The Discover Qatar website incorporates styles of elegance for hospitality and culture. The main colours are: deep teal (#0A4C56) being the primary colour to symbolize depth, along with burgundy (#751A33) which is the national flag colour which is visually linked to the country. 
In terms of typography, the font family is Jotia. 
          Jotia Medium for headings 
          Jotia Light for normal text
