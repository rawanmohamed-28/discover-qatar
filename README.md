# Discover Qatar

# About The Project
Discover Qatar is a tourism-aimed webpage designed as part of my Foundation Year Project in Computer Science. This project is aimed at coming up with an informative and visually appealing site that will introduce the users to the culture, attractions and travel prospects in Qatar. The website has 4 pages (Home, About Qatar, Places To Visit, Plan Your Trip), each focusing on a different aspect of the country. The construction of the website relied on the use of HTML and CSS using Visual Studio Code.
