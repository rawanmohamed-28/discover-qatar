# Discover Qatar Website

# About The Project
Discover Qatar is a tourism-aimed webpage designed as part of my Foundation Year Project in Computer Science. This project is aimed at coming up with an informative and visually appealing site that will introduce the users to the culture, attractions and travel prospects in Qatar. The website has 4 pages (Home, About Qatar, Places To Visit, Plan Your Trip), each focusing on a different aspect of the country. The construction of the website relied on the use of HTML and CSS using Visual Studio Code. 

# Project Aim
The primary objective of the website is to educate and inspire users about Qatar and the wonders it offers. The website is to inspire visitors and allow them to plan their trip from the golden desert to the cities. The website will allow visitors to discover all the landmarks without missing anything. Discover Qatar provides a detailed travel guide and allows the user to book their flight and accommodation, meaning the whole trip-planning is in one website.

# Style
The Discover Qatar website incorporates styles of elegance for hospitality and culture. The main colours are: deep teal (#0A4C56) being the primary colour to symbolize depth, along with burgundy (#751A33) which is the national flag colour which is visually linked to the country.
In terms of typography, the font family is Jotia.
          Jotia Medium for headings
          Jotia Light for normal text
